    abstract = "{In contrast to sexual selection on traits that affect interactions between the sexes before mating, little theoretical research has focused on the coevolution of postmating traits via cryptic female choice (when females bias fertilization toward specific males). We used simulation models to ask (a) whether and, if so, how nondirectional cryptic female choice (female-by-male interactions in fertilization success) causes deviations from models that focus exclusively on male-mediated postmating processes, and (b) how the risk of sperm competition, the strength of cryptic female choice, and tradeoffs between sperm number and sperm traits interact to influence the coevolutionary dynamics between cryptic female choice and sperm traits. We found that incorporating cryptic female choice can result in males investing much less in their ejaculates than predicted by models with sperm competition only. We also found that cryptic female choice resulted in the evolution of genetic correlations between cryptic female choice and sperm traits, even when the strength of cryptic female choice was weak, and the risk of sperm competition was low. This suggests that cryptic female choice may be important even in systems with low multiple mating. These genetic correlations increased with the risk of sperm competition and as the strength of cryptic female choice increased. When the strength of cryptic female choice and risk of sperm competition was high, extreme codivergence of sperm traits and cryptic female choice preference occurred even when the sperm trait traded off with sperm number. We also found that male traits lagged behind the evolution of female traits; this lag decreased with increasing strength of cryptic female choice and risk of sperm competition. Overall, our results suggest that cryptic female choice deserves more attention theoretically and may be driving trait evolution in ways just beginning to be explored.Sexual selection—selection on traits that aid in mating and/or fertilization success—can drive the evolution of extreme ornamentation and elaborate behaviors often in confusing and counterintuitive ways that oppose natural selection. One such example is the elaborate display of the male peacock. While typically thought of occurring before mating, sexual selection also occurs after mating in the form of sperm competition and cryptic female choice—a process in which females bias fertilization toward specific males. Postmating sexual selection can also drive elaborate traits such as in some fruit flies where sperm are often longer than male bodies. Despite decades of research demonstrating cryptic female choice, there exists almost no models to understand the coevolutionary dynamics resulting from this process. We developed models that ask (a) how male ejaculate allocation changes in response to cryptic female choice, and (b) when cryptic female choice will result in extreme trait elaboration. We found that when selection from cryptic female choice is strong, investment in ejaculate production is much lower than predicted by models with sperm competition only. We also found that cryptic female choice results in the correlated evolution of male and female traits even when selection is weak and multiple mating is infrequent, with the potential for extreme trait elaboration. Overall, our results suggest that cryptic female choice deserves more attention theoretically and may drive the evolution of male traits in ways that we are only just beginning to explore.}",
