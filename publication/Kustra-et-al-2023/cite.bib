    abstract = { AbstractSeveral predictions of sperm competition theory are not well supported empirically. One potential reason is that most current theory and empirical research ignore how the social environment influence the temporal dynamics of mating. We propose that understanding these dynamics is key to understanding sexual selection and improving the predictive power of theory. To demonstrate the importance of these dynamics, we quantify how malesâ€™ social role, interactions among males, and current social environment influence the timing of mating in Symphodus ocellatus, a species with three alternative male reproductive tactics. Nesting males spawn synchronously with females; sneakers and satellites sneak-spawn with some time delay. Satellites also cooperate with nesting males. We found that satellites have shorter sneak-spawning delays than sneakers, a benefit of their cooperation with nesting males. Sneak-spawning delays decreased with increasing nest activity for sneakers but not for satellites, suggesting that sneakers may benefit from increased sperm competition intensity. Current sperm competition models ignore this potential benefit, which may be why the prediction that males should decrease investment when sperm competition involves more than two males is not well supported. Our study provides insight into mechanisms that drive variation in the timing of spawning, which could explain mismatches between theoretical and empirical results. }
