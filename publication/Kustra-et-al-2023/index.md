abstract: Several predictions of sperm competition theory are not well supported empirically.
  One potential reason is that most current theory and empirical research ignore how
  the social environment influence the temporal dynamics of mating. We propose that
  understanding these dynamics is key to understanding sexual selection and improving
  the predictive power of theory. To demonstrate the importance of these dynamics,
  we quantify how malesâ€™ social role, interactions among males, and current social
  environment influence the timing of mating in Symphodus ocellatus, a species with
  three alternative male reproductive tactics. Nesting males spawn synchronously with
  females; sneakers and satellites sneak-spawn with some time-delay. Satellites also
  cooperate with nesting males. We found that satellites have shorter sneak-spawning
  delays than sneakers, a benefit of their cooperation with nesting males. Sneak-spawning
  delays decreased with increasing nest activity for sneakers but not satellites,
  suggesting sneakers may benefit from increased sperm competition intensity. Current
  sperm competition models ignore this potential benefit which may be why the prediction
  that males should decrease investment when sperm competition involves more than
  two males is not well supported. Our study provides insight into mechanisms that
  drive variation in the timing of spawning, which could explain mismatches between
  theoretical and empirical results.
