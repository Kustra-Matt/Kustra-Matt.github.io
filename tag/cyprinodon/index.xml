      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am using whole genome sequencing in combination with functional genetics to provide insight into the speciation process and trophic specialization in an adaptive radiation of &lt;em&gt;Cyprinodon&lt;/em&gt; pupfishes endemic to Lake Chichancanab, Mexico. I have identified 55 candidate genes under selection with highly differentiated SNPs between the zooplankton specialist and the other species in the radiation. I am currently functionally validating some of these candidate loci and generating QTL crosses to map phenotypic traits (teeth, jaw, sperm) that have rapidly diverged in this young radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lake Chichancanab has unique water chemistry, so I am also studying the genetics underlying local adaptation to this unique environment. Becuase pupfish have external fertilization, I am looking at local adaptation of eggs and sperm. Preliminary data suggests local adaptation of sperm performance as well as differences in sperm and egg morphology. I am currently generating QTL crosses to map these traits.&lt;/p&gt;
