One habitat that is increasingly recognized to contain phylogenetically related lineages of reproductive manipulators is the ocean. The reproduction of marine invertebrates often occurs by free-spawning instead of by the physical contact of copulation in terrestrial systems. We developed an integrated model to understand whether and when microbes that manipulate host reproduction by cytoplasmic incompatibility, feminization, and male killing spread within populations of free-spawning marine invertebrates. Our model support three primary findings. First, sex ratio distortion leads to suboptimal fertilization and zygote production in planktotrophs (feeding larvae), but enhance these processes in lecithotrophs (nonfeeding larvae). Second, feminization and a combination of male killing plus enhanced growth are effective at spreading reproductive manipulators while also inducing a female-biased sex ratio. Third, the majority of free-spawning marine invertebrates could be infected across a range of life-history combinations, with infections harming species with smaller eggs and longer pelagic durations while benefiting species with larger eggs and shorter pelagic durations. Together, this supports the general premise that microbes may manipulate the reproduction of free-spawning marine invertebrates (e.g., by inducing changes in developmental life-history) and that these types of manipulations overlap considerably with terrestrial systems.","tags":["Cytoplasmic incompatability","Feminization","Male killing","Fertilization","Sea urchins","Life-history evolution","Endosymbiont","Theory"],"title":"On the spread of microbes that manipulate reproduction in marine invertebrates","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction ‘ggplot2’ is a popular graphing package for the R programming language. Once you’ve learned the logic and the general grammar of “ggplot2” it becomes easy to make publication ready graphs. Unfortunately, the learning curve can be pretty steep, especially if you are used to using basic R plots. This is a tutorial to help you get started making graphs in ‘ggplot2’ and help get through some of the learning curve.\nGetting ready First, let’s install the required packages for this tutorial. We will need to install ggplot2 and the palmerpenguins packages. The ‘palmerpenguins’ package has a great dataset we will be using for this tutorial.\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;ggplot2\u0026#34;) install.packages(\u0026#34;palmerpenguins\u0026#34;)  Next we need to load up the packages.\nlibrary(ggplot2) library(palmerpenguins)  Loading up and checking the data Unlike plotting with base R. ggplot2 requires data frames to make graphs. For this tutorial we will use the penguin dataset from the package ‘palmerpenguins.’ Let’s get some info about the data set, using str function which tells us each column, type of data and starts printing out columns.\nstr(penguins)  ## tibble [333 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ species : Factor w/ 3 levels \u0026#34;Adelie\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Chinstrap\u0026#34;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ island : Factor w/ 3 levels \u0026#34;Biscoe\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Dream\u0026#34;,..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ... ## $ bill_length_mm : num [1:333] 39.1 39.5 40.3 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 41.1 38.6 34.6 ... ## $ bill_depth_mm : num [1:333] 18.7 17.4 18 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 17.6 21.2 21.1 ... ## $ flipper_length_mm: int [1:333] 181 186 195 193 190 181 195 182 191 198 ... ## $ body_mass_g : int [1:333] 3750 3800 3250 3450 3650 3625 4675 3200 3800 4400 ... ## $ sex : Factor w/ 2 levels \u0026#34;female\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;male\u0026#34;: 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 ... ## $ year : int [1:333] 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...  Making our first ggplot2 graph In this section we will make our first ggplot2 graph! For simplicity we will to a scatter plot of bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm to see the relationship of these two variables.\nInitializing ggplot2 The first step of making a plot with ggplot2 is to initialize the plot with the function ggplot(). The first argument of the ggplot() function is the dataframe you are using and the second argument defines how you want to map the columns to various components of the graph (e.g., which column will be the x-axis).\nFor example to make a scatter plot of bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm:\nggplot(data=penguins,aes(x=bill_length_mm,y=bill_depth_mm))  But it looks empty! Exactly, that’s because we haven’t actually specified what we want to plot. The ggplot function just gives us the set up, we have to tell R what we want to plot.\nAdding geoms (making a scatter plot) To actually visualize our data using ggplot2, we need to use “geoms”. Geoms are ways to visually represent our data and ggplot2 has many different options. Here is a great resource to see some of the possibilities.\nIn our case, since we want to make a scatter plot, we just need to add geom_point():\nggplot(data=penguins,aes(x=bill_length_mm,y=bill_depth_mm))+ geom_point()  Color aesthetics It looks like we have three different clusters. Looking back at the data maybe these three different clusters represent the three different species in our data set?\nOne way we could visualize this is by giving each species a different color, using the color parameter. Since, we are matching some sort of aesthetic to a variable in our data frame it has to go inside aes() like so:\nggplot(data=penguins,aes(x=bill_length_mm,y=bill_depth_mm,color=species))+ geom_point()  Adding another geom (a line of best fit) A cool thing with ggplot2 is that it is very easy to add more layers. All we have to do is another + geom_xxx. A logical next step for this scatter plot is to add a line of best fit using the geom_smooth():\nggplot(data=penguins,aes(x=bill_length_mm,y=bill_depth_mm,color=species))+ geom_point()+ geom_smooth()  ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;  It looks a little weird. That’s because by default geom_smooth uses a “loess” function to fit the data. Essentially this fits seperate polynomial functions between various points of your data and strings them together. Often this is not appropriate and vastly overfits your data. The grey shading, by default, shows the 95% confidence interval of the fit.\nWe can specify a specific formula for geom_smooth() but this is out of the scope of this tutorial. Instead, let’s just fit a strait line. The way we do this is by passing the argument method=\u0026#34;lm\u0026#34; in geom_smooth(). “lm” in this case stands for linear model:\nggplot(data=penguins,aes(x=bill_length_mm,y=bill_depth_mm,color=species))+ geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method=\u0026#34;lm\u0026#34;)  ## `geom_smooth()` using formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;  A side note on aes() If you noticed, it fit a separate line and used different colors for the three species. This is because whatever mappings (i.e., whatever is in the aes()) you put within the ggplot() in the first line …","date":1633392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633392000,"objectID":"84a876ba789bb7232be8d9ed2487fd98","permalink":"https://kustra-matt.github.io/post/2020-12-01-r-rmarkdown/","publishdate":"2021-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-12-01-r-rmarkdown/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction ‘ggplot2’ is a popular graphing package for the R programming language.

Ejaculates present many potential targets for postcopulatory selection (e.g., sperm morphology, count, and velocity), which are often highly correlated and potentially subject to complex multivariate selection. Although multivariate selection on ejaculate traits has been observed in laboratory experiments, it is unclear whether selection is similarly complex in wild populations, where individuals mate frequently over longer periods of time. We measured univariate and multivariate selection on sperm morphology, sperm count, and sperm velocity in a wild population of brown anole lizards (*Anolis sagrei*). We conducted a mark-recapture study with genetic parentage assignment to estimate individual reproductive success. We found significant negative directional selection and negative quadratic selection on sperm count, but we did not detect directional or quadratic selection on any other sperm traits, nor did we detect correlational selection on any trait combinations. Our results may reflect pressure on males to produce many small ejaculates and mate frequently over a six-month reproductive season. This study is the first to measure multivariate selection on sperm traits in a wild population and provides an interesting contrast to experimental studies of external fertilizers, which have found complex multivariate selection on sperm phenotypes.","tags":["Sperm competion","Anolis sagrei","Spatial ecology"],"title":"Selection on Sperm Count, but Not on Sperm Morphology or Velocity, in a Wild Population of Anolis Lizards","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Melissa Cronin","Suzanne Alonzo","Stephanie Adamczak","D.

Many academic EECB departments seek concrete ways to improve the climate and implement anti-racist policies in their teaching, training and research activities. We present a toolkit of evidence-based interventions for academic EECB departments to foster anti-racism in three areas: in the classroom; within research laboratories; and department wide. To spark restorative discussion and action in these areas, we summarize EECB’s racist and ethnocentric histories, as well as current systemic problems that marginalize non-white groups.

The resulting patterns of selection could lead to between-tactic differences in ejaculate traits. Despite extensive research on male ARTs, there is no comprehensive review of whether and what differences in sperm traits exist between male ARTs. We review existing theory on ejaculate evolution relevant to ARTs and then conduct a comprehensive vote-counting review of the empirical data comparing sperm traits between males adopting ARTs. Despite the general expectation that sneaker males should produce sperm that are more competitive (e.g. higher quality or performance), we find that existing theory does not predict explicitly how males adopting ARTs should differ in sperm traits. The majority of studies find no significant difference in sperm performance traits between dominant and sneaker males. However, when there is a difference, sneaker males tend to have higher sperm performance trait values than dominant males. We propose ways that future theoretical and empirical research can improve our understanding of the evolution of ejaculate traits in ARTs. We then highlight how studying ejaculate traits in species with ARTs will improve our broader knowledge of ejaculate evolution.","tags":["Review","Alternative reproductive tactics","Sperm competition","Theory"],"title":"Sperm and alternative reproductive tactics: a review of existing theory and empirical data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Kustra","Ariel Kahrl","Aaron Reedy","Daniel Warner","Robert Cox"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1571270400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571270400,"objectID":"08add501cf0a70d853adfc6482017742","permalink":"https://kustra-matt.github.io/publication/kustra-et-al-2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kustra-et-al-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Given that sperm production can be costly, theory predicts that males should optimally adjust the quantity and/or quality of their sperm in response to their social environment to maximize their paternity success. Although experiments demonstrate that males can alter their ejaculates in response to manipulations of the social environment and studies show that ejaculate traits covary with social environment across populations, it is unknown whether individual variation in sperm traits corresponds to natural variation found within wild populations. Using an island population of brown anole lizards (*Anolis sagrei*), we tested the prediction that sperm traits (sperm count, sperm morphology, sperm velocity) respond to natural variation in the risk of sperm competition, as inferred from the local density and operational sex ratio (OSR) of conspecifics. We found that males living in high-density areas of the island produced relatively larger sperm midpieces, smaller sperm heads, and lower sperm counts. Sperm traits were unrelated to OSR after accounting for the covariance between OSR and density. Our findings broaden the implications of sperm competition theory to intrapopulation social environment variation by showing that sperm count and sperm morphology vary with fine-scale differences in density within a single wild population","tags":["Sperm competion","Anolis sagrei","Spatial ecology"],"title":"Sperm morphology and count vary with fine-scale changes in local density in a wild lizard population","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
